ConnectBot is a secure shell client for the Android platform. Its ultimate goal is to create a secure connection through which you can use a shell on a remote machine and transfer files back and forth to your phone.

# Development Team

The current development team consists of [Kenny Root](https://the-b.org/), Paul Evans, and Torne Wuff.

All of us are on the <strong>#connectbot</strong> channel on [Freenode](https://freenode.net/) if you have questions. You can join via Freenode's [webchat](https://webchat.freenode.net/) system or your own IRC client.
